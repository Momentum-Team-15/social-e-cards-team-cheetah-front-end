Bad Token
When logged in as 
    avatar 
    token was "db30e656984e15f94c0e6bb4ec76f8465b803580"
    logged out
    saw local storage username and token return to empty and null values 
    logged back in as avatar
    new token returned same value as before 
    this [new token] value returns Invalid Token
    logged out
    saw local storage username and token return to empty and null values 
    logged in as cwebsterg
    token returned "3ad482e46367ba1b157ebbb999cbf193cebf2367"
    logged out
    logged back in as cwebsterg
    token returned "3ad482e46367ba1b157ebbb999cbf193cebf2367"

    is it possible be holding the token? thinking I am logging out of react but NOT sending correct request to destroy token. Possible?
